CASE
A CASE statement allows us to create different outputs (usually in the SELECT statement). It is SQL's way of handling if-then logic.
e.g.
SELECT name,
	CASE
  	WHEN imdb_rating > 8 THEN "Fantastic"
    WHEN imdb_rating > 6 THEN "Poorly Received"
    ELSE "Avoid at All Costs"
  END AS "Review"
FROM movies;
