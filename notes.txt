CASE
A CASE statement allows us to create different outputs (usually in the SELECT statement). It is SQL's way of handling if-then logic.
e.g.
SELECT name,
	CASE
  	WHEN imdb_rating > 8 THEN "Fantastic"
    WHEN imdb_rating > 6 THEN "Poorly Received"
    ELSE "Avoid at All Costs"
  END AS "Review"
FROM movies;


We just learned how to query data from a database using SQL. We also learned how to filter queries to make the information more specific and useful.

Let's summarize:

SELECT is the clause we use every time we want to query information from a database.
AS renames a column or table.
DISTINCT return unique values.
WHERE is a popular command that lets you filter the results of the query based on conditions that you specify.
LIKE and BETWEEN are special operators.
AND and OR combines multiple conditions.
ORDER BY sorts the result.
LIMIT specifies the maximum number of rows that the query will return.
CASE creates different outputs.
